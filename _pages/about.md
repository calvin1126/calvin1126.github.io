I am a PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis (UCD). I am specialized in `quantum simulation, machine learning and data science` for material developments. My current research focuses on the design of catalytic materials for CO2 capture. I have applied `density functional theory (DFT)` calculations, `molecular dynamics (MD)` and `machine learning (ML)` on `high performance computing (HPC)` system to model the material. I was also a research intern in the Quantum Simulation Group (QSG) at the Lawrence Livermore Naitonal Lab (LLNL). There, I applied computational methods to study the lithium de-solvation process at the electrolyte-electrode interface for battery applications. Prior to my PhD journey, I was a master student at the University of Washington. I had built up my hands-on experiement experineces in protein engineering and molecular biology to design and synthesize biomaterials for drug delivery application. My research interests include `advanced computing, advanced materials engineering, and clean energy generation and storage`.
